>The Python Workshop focuses on building up your practical skills 
so that you can work towards building your skills as a Engineer/ data scientist, 
write scripts that help automate your life and save you time, 
or even create your own games and desktop applications.

You'll build and iterate on your code like a software developer, learning along the way. This process means that you'll find that your new skills stick, embedded as best practice. A solid foundation for the years ahead.
